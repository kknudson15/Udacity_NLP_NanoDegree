# Udacity_NLP_NanoDegree
This Repository Contains my work going through the Natural Language Processing NanoDegree and any related materials that I completed in route to completing the NanoDegree.  There are 3 main projects in the program and many smaller mini projects, with some of that work being represented in this repository.  

## **Main Projects in the NanoDegree are:** 
  1. [Parts of Speech Tagging](#project-1-parts-of-speech-tagging)
  2. [Machine Translation](#project-2-machine-translation)
  3. [DNN Speech Recognizer](#project-3-dnn-speech-recognizer)
  4. [Mini Projects](#other-mini-projects)
  

## **Project 1:Parts of Speech Tagging**  
### **_Description:_** 
Built a Parts of speech tagger using hidden markov models.  These types of models have been shown to achieve up to 96% accuracy in taggging with larger corpa.

### **_Technical Concepts Used:_**
Hidden Markov Models
Most Frequent Class Taggers 
Hidden Markov Model Taggers
Textual Data Structures
  
### **_What I learned:_**
I learned to build various types of parts of speech taggers and some of the mathematical concepts that underly these useful techniques.  This was a good practice for implementing some of the NLP concepts that were discussed in this section.


## **Project 2: Machine Translation** 

### **_Description:_**
In this project, I built a deep neural network that was a part of an end to end machine translation pipeline.  The pipeline will take English text as an input and provide the french translation as an output.  


### **_Technical Concepts Used:_**
Tokenization 
Padding 
preprocessing pipelines 
RNN 
RNN with Embedding
BiDirectional RNN 
Encoder-Decoder RNN
Custom RNN
  
### **_What I learned:_**
Finishing this project gave me the ability to build deep neural networks that are capable of processing textual data in a meaningful and practival way.  The project had me build different types of RNNs and allowed me to see a comparison and learn to work with different types of networks.  At the end of the project, you are asked to design your own custom RNN based on the performance of the others that I built and I found this to be a great exercise at taking information and designing a network in an appropriate way.   

## **Project 3: DNN Speech Recognizer**
### **_Description:_**
In this project, I built a deep neural network that is part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition pipeline.  The pipeline would take in preprocessed audio data and output a predicted transcription.  

### **_Technical Concepts Used:_**
Spectrograms
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients 
raw audio processing 
RNN 
RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
CNN + RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
Deeper RNN + TimeDistributed Dense
Bidirectional RNN + TimeDistributed Dense

  
### **_What I learned:_**
This project taught me how to work with raw audio data and how to utilize different types of network configurations to achieve audio transcription.  I was able to work with various types of RNNs and even a CNN to achieve this task.  This is a common task in present day and this showed another example of how RNNs are capable of handling natural language processing very well.
