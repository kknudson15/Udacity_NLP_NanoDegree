# Udacity_NLP_NanoDegree
This Repository Contains my work going through the Natural Language Processing NanoDegree and any related materials that I completed in route to completing the NanoDegree.  There are 3 main projects in the program and many smaller mini projects, with some of that work being represented in this repository.  

## **Main Projects in the NanoDegree are:** 
  1. [My first Neural Network](#project-1-parts-of-speech-tagging)
  2. [Dog Project](#project-2-machine-translation)
  3. [Script Generation](#project-3-dnn-speech-recognizer)
  4. [Mini Projects](#other-mini-projects)
